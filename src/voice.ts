// @livliv-dev/player/voice: lip sync. The mouth follows a voice (loudness, and the vowel's shape where the model has round /
// wide mouths), and without face tracking the voice also moves the head, brows and eyes a little, the way people move
// while they talk. Two ways in:
//  - startLipSync: live audio (the microphone, a call's MediaStream, or an <audio> / <video> element the page plays)
//  - createSpeech: speech clips (TTS) the player plays itself, back to back; the mouth follows each one exactly, from
//    its loudness worked out when it is decoded and read at the moment the sound leaves the speakers
